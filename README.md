# KEGG Pathway Overlap Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based analysis pipeline to study **gene overlaps and crosstalk between KEGG pathways** in humans. The analysis computes overlapping genes between pathways, ranks genes by pathway frequency, and visualizes pathway networks and gene overlaps.
